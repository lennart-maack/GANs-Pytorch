-  The goal is to find a target wall with a specified color within the maze. 
-  The target color (red, green, and blue) can be selected in a menu after the program starts.
-  The code has to be written in .java and follows the modular design patterns (Decomposability, Composability, Understandability, Continuity, Protection)
